# hello_world
This is my introduction to GitHub

I'm a marine ecologist interested in questions about marine ecosystems reponse to, and recovery from, anthropogenic disturbances including harvest, species introduction, and climate change. I use both empirical and modeling approaches to understand how species interactions structure biological communities and how these interactions mediate response to perturbation. 

I use R and Mathematica in my research and will be using GitHUb for making code publically availble, for version control, and for collaboration.

This commit incorporates changes to the README file
